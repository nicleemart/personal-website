		<h1>The Web</h1>
	<p>The web is used as a medium in that there are a lot of design aspects involved within HTML and CSS. Even if we donâ€™t know it, this is how we see the web and how the majority of us interact with it on a day-to-day basis as opposed to the actual Internet. HTML is a language used to give content and structure to a website, while CSS is used to make it visually appealing.</p>

	<p>HTML works as the core of every web page. It uses tags to present us with different content, such as text, links and images. Additionally, nothing special is required to write in HTML. As long as a computer has a text editor, it can be used to develop a website. With this basic content, we use CSS to make it more appealing and even improve functionality.</p>

	<p>What I still wonder about the web is how all the different web languages, such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, work together.</p>
