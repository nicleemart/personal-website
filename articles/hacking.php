<p>This article discusses the ethics of hacking. The initial focus of the article is on an 18-year-old who had recently graduated from high school. He spent his free time hacking US Defense Department websites, and instead of getting in trouble, was actually praised by the Pentagon for finding bugs.</p>

<p>I found it interesting that despite the bad connotation of the word &quot;hack&quot; to most people, the US government is paying people to hack their information. I knew that this was a thing, but I didn&#39;t know that so many people were a part of it. According to the article, over 1,400 people participated. The article also mentioned hacking competitions that US companies have held in order to find bugs in their system. I didn&#39;t realize that those were a regular thing that actually happened. The use of this by the government is very smart. Apparently, this kind of work could cost over one million dollars if done by a security company. Instead, this project only cost $150,000.</p>

<p>The terms &quot;black hat&quot; and &quot;white hat&quot; hacker were new to me. I didn&#39;t realize there were proper terms for &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot; hackers. Black hats are the stereotypical &quot;bad&quot; hackers who break into websites to steal information for their own gain. White hats are hackers usually employed by a company in order to find bugs.</p>

<p>I do also believe that this article highlights one reason why kids should be encouraged to code. If they are good enough at it, there are definitely some non-traditional career options out there that could suit them well, as the boy mentioned in the article has already been approached by recruiters for internship options that could lead to a future career.</p>
